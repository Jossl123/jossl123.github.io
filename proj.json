In the real life the light comme from the light source to our eyes and in raycsating we launch the ray from the eye to the lights sources.<br><br> We 'launch', for every pixel in the screen, ray (represented by a vector) in a 3d world (represented by some object and their properties like their color). We then found what color did the ray touch (go check out the raymarching project) and color the pixel like so. <br><br> This is just a starting point but if you're insterested go checkout <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz0KTGYJtUk' target='_blank'>Sebastian Lague videos</a> on the subject : ",
